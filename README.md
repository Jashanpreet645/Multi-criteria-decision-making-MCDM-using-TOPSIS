# Multi-criteria-decision-making-MCDM-using-Topsis
TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a popular method in decision-making that identifies the best option by comparing alternatives against an ideal and a worst-case solution. This repository offers an in-depth implementation of TOPSIS in Python, complete with examples, datasets, and reusable functions.

# üéØ Key Highlights

- Step-by-step implementation of the TOPSIS algorithm.
- Support for various types of criteria: benefit and cost.
- Example datasets for hands-on practice.
- Visualization of rankings for better interpretation.

# Key Steps in TOPSIS

1Ô∏è‚É£ Normalization: Convert the decision matrix into a normalized matrix to ensure all criteria are on a comparable scale.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Weighted Normalization: Apply weights to criteria based on their importance.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Determine Ideal Solutions: Identify the positive ideal solution (PIS) and the negative ideal solution (NIS).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance of each alternative from PIS and NIS.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking Alternatives: Rank the alternatives based on their relative closeness to the ideal solution.
